    "I wanted an explanation for HAMTs (Hash Array Mapped Tries) that was more detailed than [Marek Majkowski's introduction](https://idea.popcount.org/2012-07-25-introduction-to-hamt/) and more approachable than [_Ideal Hash Trees_ by Phil Bagwell](https://lampwww.epfl.ch/papers/idealhashtrees.pdf), the paper that introduced them. HAMTs form the backbone of the [`unordered-containers`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/unordered-containers) library but the [implementation has been lovingly optimised](https://github.com/tibbe/unordered-containers/blob/efa43a2ab09dc6eb72893d12676a8e188cb4ca63/Data/HashMap/Base.hs) to the point where I think it's too complex to make sense of if you don't already have a good grasp of the underlying concepts. Finally I found [Edward Z. Yang's implementation](https://github.com/ezyang/hamt/blob/a43559795630980eb16ab832a003d8e6acd21cf6/HAMT.hs) and after adapting it I think I'm in a good place to attempt this explanation.\n",
